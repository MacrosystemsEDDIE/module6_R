# Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts: Detailed Rubric

The rubric below is intended as a template, to be modified by instructors for their specific course. Students should verify with instructors as to how the assignment is to be submitted and graded. Here, it is assumed that students are knitting their assignments as an html file.

## Module weight: 30 pts

Note that module and question weights can be scaled depending on course needs (for example, all point values could be doubled for a module weight of 60 points, or just question weights can be doubled to put more emphasis on question responses rather than use of RMarkdown).

- 1 pt per question for Questions 1-27 in module6.Rmd (total of 27 pts)
    - **0 pts**: no code or answer provided
    - **0.5 pts**: Code provided and includes at least one correct step but is not complete AND/OR (if text answer) response present but limited in depth of answer
    - **1 pt**: Correct code provided AND/OR insightful text answer provided that correctly describes patterns or addresses question.
    
- 3 pts for correct use of RMarkdown
    - **0 pts**: No changes evident on the Rmarkdown file or formatting in Rmarkdown incorrect (e.g. code outside code blocks, text inside code blocks, etc); html does not exist (no knitting occurred).
    - **1pts**: Evidence of changes made to the Rmarkdown with correct formatting; html does not exist (no knitting occurred) or is totally out of sync with the .Rmd changes.
    - **2pts**: RMarkdown is synced with a knitted html, but RMarkdown or html has extreme errors or formatting issues that should have been caught by a cursory review before submission.
        _OR_ RMarkdown and knitted html are out of sync so newest changes and plots added to RMarkdown are not displaying in html. RMarkdown and html look otherwise clean and nicely formatted.
    - **3pts** Synced RMarkdown and knitted html. RMarkdown and html look clean and nicely formatted.
