# Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts: Detailed Rubric

The rubric below is intended as a template, to be modified by instructors for their specific course. Students should verify with instructors as to how the assignment is to be submitted and graded. Here, it is assumed that students are knitting their assignments as a .md file and committing the assignment to a class GitHub organization to submit.

## Module weight: 60 pts

- 2 pts per question for Questions 1-27 in module6.Rmd (total of 54 pts)
    - **0pts**: no code or answer provided
    - **1 pt**: Code provided and includes at least one correct step but is not complete AND/OR (if text answer) response present but limited in depth of answer
    - **2 pt**: Correct code provided AND/OR insightful text answer provided that correctly describes patterns or addresses question.
    
- 4 pts for RMarkdown
    - **0pts**: No .md or plots committed. No changes evident on the Rmarkdown file or formatting in Rmarkdown incorrect (e.g. code outside code blocks, text inside code blocks, etc)
    - **1pts**: Evidence of knitting, committing, and pushing changes to Rmarkdown but knit to an html, pdf, doc, or other not .md output. 
        _OR_ Knit only once and .md is totally out of sync with the .Rmd changes.
    - **2pts**: Synced .Rmd, .md, and all plots committed and displaying properly. Markdown has extreme errors or formatting issues that should have been caught by a cursory review before submission.
    - **3pts** Synced .Rmd, .md committed, but not all plots committed and/or displaying properly. Markdown otherwise looks clean and nicely formatted.
        _OR_ .Rmd, .md, and plot files all committed but out of sync so newest changes and plots add to Rmd not displaying. Markdown looks otherwise clean and nicely formatted.
    - **4pts**: Synced .Rmd, .md, and plot files all committed, plots displaying properly. Markdown looks clean and nicely formatted.
    
- 2 pts for GitHub
  - **0 pts**: assignment not found on course GitHub organization
