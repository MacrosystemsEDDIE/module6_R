# Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts: Detailed Rubric

The rubric below is intended as a template, to be modified by instructors for their specific course. Students should verify with instructors as to how the assignment is to be submitted and graded. Here, it is assumed that students are knitting their assignments as an html file and committing the assignment to a class GitHub organization to submit.

## Module weight: 27 pts (or 30 pts if the instructor assesses student use of RMarkdown and GitHub)

Note that module and question weights can be scaled depending on course needs (for example, all point values could be doubled for a module weight of 60 points, or just question weights can be doubled to put more emphasis on question responses rather than use of RMarkdown and GitHub).

- 1 pt per question for Questions 1-27 in module6.Rmd (total of 27 pts)
    - **0 pts**: no code or answer provided
    - **0.5 pts**: Code provided and includes at least one correct step but is not complete AND/OR (if text answer) response present but limited in depth of answer
    - **1 pt**: Correct code provided AND/OR insightful text answer provided that correctly describes patterns or addresses question.
    
- (Optional) 3 pts for correct use of RMarkdown and GitHub
    - **0 pts**: No knitted files or plots committed. No changes evident on the Rmarkdown file or formatting in Rmarkdown incorrect (e.g. code outside code blocks, text inside code blocks, etc); assignment not found on course GitHub organization.
    - **1pts**: Evidence of committing and pushing changes made to the Rmarkdown to GitHub; html does not exist or is totally out of sync with the .Rmd changes (no knitting occurred).
    - **2pts**: Synced .Rmd and knitted html pushed to GitHub, but Markdown has extreme errors or formatting issues that should have been caught by a cursory review before submission.
        _OR_ .Rmd, knitted html, and plot files all committed but out of sync so newest changes and plots add to Rmd not displaying. Markdown looks otherwise clean and nicely formatted.
    - **3pts** Assignment found on course GitHub and multiple commits provided. Synced .Rmd, .md, and plot files all committed, plots displaying properly. Markdown looks clean and nicely formatted.
