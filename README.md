# Macrosystems EDDIE Module 6: Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts
  
This repository is a template for every student's Macrosystems EDDIE Module 6: Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts. This is the fifth module of FREC 3044 Environmental Data Science, intended to introduce key concepts and skills to account for uncertainty in ecological forecasts.
  
## Assignment
  
All work for this assignment is in the `assignment` directory.  Code is contained in the `module6_assignment.Rmd` notebook, and final rendered output files (`module6_assignment.md` and associated files) are in the `assignment` directory as well. The general rubric you will be graded on is found in the `rubric.md` file. 
  
## Other files
  
Additionally this repository, and all student repositories, includes most of the files and folders found here:
  
- `README.md` a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `lesson.md` a description of the assignment.
- `rubric.md` the rubric for how the module will be assessed.
- `.gitignore` an optional file, used to ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `*.Rproj` an R-Project file created by RStudio for its own configuration of the repo files. Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file. It is optional for team repos to ignore or commit their own `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` file. 
- `/module_admin` a folder containing data and code required for continued maintenance and development of the module. This folder is not needed to run the module. Students and instructors can `.gitignore` this folder.
